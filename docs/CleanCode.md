# Pratice for clean code

To make the code maintainable, it was done:

1. Typed variables were used
2. The following principles were used:
    - "SOLE RESPONSIBILITY"
    - DRY (Don't repeat yourself)
    - KISS (Keep it easy, stupid!)
3. Self documented code and minimum necessary documentation
and finally, a series of good practices based on
books like "Clena code" and in such a way to have a good appointment
of files and variables, PEP8 practices, among others
